/**
 * 实现接口按名解析视图
 * Interface to be implemented by objects that can resolve views by name.
 *
 * 应用程序运行时视图状态不会发生变化，因此实现类可以自由缓存视图。
 * <p>View state doesn't change during the running of the application,
 * so implementations are free to cache views.
 *
 * 实现类鼓励支持国际化，例如视图解析本地化。
 * <p>Implementations are encouraged to support internationalization,
 * i.e. localized view resolution.

	 * 当然这并不是硬性要求：有些解析器无法解析出视图，也不会返回null，而是改用抛出异常方式来解决这种情况。
	 * Resolve the given view by name.
	 * <p>Note: To allow for ViewResolver chaining, a ViewResolver should
	 * return {@code null} if a view with the given name is not defined in it.
	 * However, this is not required: Some ViewResolvers will always attempt
	 * to build View objects with the given name, unable to return {@code null}
	 * (rather throwing an exception when View creation failed).
	 * @param viewName name of the view to resolve
	 * @param locale Locale in which to resolve the view.
	 * ViewResolvers that support internationalization should respect this.
	 * @return the View object, or {@code null} if not found
	 * (optional, to allow for ViewResolver chaining)
	 * @throws Exception if the view cannot be resolved
	 * (typically in case of problems creating an actual View object)
